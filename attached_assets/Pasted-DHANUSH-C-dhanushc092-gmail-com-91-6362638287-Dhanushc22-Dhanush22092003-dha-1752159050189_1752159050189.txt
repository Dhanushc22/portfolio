BinaryBox – Offline File-to-Binary Converter  
Android Studio, Java, XML  
A privacy-focused Android app that securely converts any file into a binary string and restores it— all entirely offline:  
  
•	Two-Way Conversion: o File → Binary – Converts files into binary strings for secure storage.  
 	o  Binary → File – Restores original files from binary input.  
•	Offline Processing: All operations are handled locally on-device, ensuring no data is transmitted over the internet.  
•	Privacy-Centric Design: Ideal for users handling sensitive files or working in secure environments.  
•	Theme Customization: Users can personalize the UI with multiple color themes.  
•	Lightweight & Optimized: Runs efficiently even on low-end Android devices.

NeuroSynk – Smartwatch-Powered Heart Health Monitoring App  
Flutter, Dart, BLE (flutter_blue_plus), Node.js, MongoDB, Hive, fl_chart  
Developed a cross-platform health monitoring app that connects with BLE-enabled smartwatches to provide real-time cardiovascular insights and heart attack detection.  
•	ECG-like PPG Analysis: Reconstructed QRS-like waveforms from raw PPG signals; calculated HRV, QRS, PR, and QTc intervals.  
•	Real-Time Monitoring: Live tracking of heart rate, blood pressure, and SpO₂ with automated 3minute health monitoring cycles.  
•	Heart Attack Alerts: Triggered emergency warnings based on biometric thresholds (e.g., HR > 130, BP > 140, HRV drops, arrhythmias).  
•	BLE Integration: Robust pairing with BLE smartwatches using standard and custom UUIDs, with reconnect logic and live sync via Socket.IO.  
•	Data Visualization & Export: Displayed live and historical graphs using fl_chart, stored data in Hive, with export to CSV/JSON.  
•	Secure Backend: Node.js/Express API with JWT auth, MongoDB for session storage, and WebSocket support for real-time sync.
